# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from that 8/16 split to a 12/12 split, so the new macmid will be

# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,

#   BCM947186nrh  0x008

#   - 11n rates mcs8-mcs15, mcs16-mcs23, and mcs24-mcs31 will have the same power-per-rate offsets corresponding to mcs0-mcs7.
#       In other words, the power-per-rate offsets on each chain are irrepsective of the number of streams
#
#   - 11ac rates mcs0-mcs9 will have the same power-per-rate offsets on each chain irrespective of the number of streams
#
#   - mcs32 uses the same power offsets as legacy 40Dup 6 Mbps

# The following sections are to configure on-board (WOMBO) 43217 chip, 2.4GHz side, as it does not have an SROM.
# These parameters take the place of the SROM contents. These parameters are for sromrev=9.
# These parameters must have a special prefix. The format is:
#   'pci/<bus_#>/<slot_#>/<param>'
#
#   where: <bus_#> is the PCI/PCIe bus number ?always "1" for PCI. For PCIe it is the RC (root complex) number + 1.
#             (Ex: bus_# = 1 for the first RC/PCIe port. bus_# = 2 for the second RC/PCIe port.)
#          <slot_#> slot number of the WOMBO chip (old PCI only. Is always "1" for PCIe.)
#             slot 0 is the RC in the CPU chip (i.e. the 4708)
#             slot = 1 PCI:  if PCI_AD17 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#             slot = 2 PCI:  if PCI_AD18 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#             slot = 3 PCI:  if PCI_AD19 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"

# Due to the increasing number of NVRAM parameters being added with new wireless chips, sometimes the NVRAM will grow too
# large and not fit in the 4K allocated to it in the CFE image. In order to compress the NVRAM somewhat, the
# "devpathX=<prefix>" notation can be used.
#
# In this notation the "<prefix>" value is the usual prefix as decribed above, like "pci/1/1/".
# The "X" in "devpathX" is a unique number from 0-9. Multiple "devpaths" are supported per NVRAM file. This will be
# needed when a board has multiple wireless chips/interfaces. Suggest to start "X" from 0, and count up.
#
# Then for each prefixed NVRAM parameter, the "X:" part is replaced by <prefix> in the NVRAM parser. This saves space by
# reducing the prefix length from about eight characters ("pci/1/1/") down to two ("sb/1/").
#
# Example:
#   Instead of
#     0:boardflags=0x80001200
#     0:boardflags2=0x00100000
#
#   Use the "devpath" notation:
#     devpath0=0:
#     0:boardflags=0x80001200
#     0:boardflags2=0x00100000
#
devpath0=pci/1/1/

0:venid=0x14e4

# boardvendor is the same as venid

# NOTE: When SROM parameters are used in NVRAM, the "pci/1/1/boardtype", "pci/1/1/boardrev", and "pci/1/1/boardnum"
#       parameters should NOT be placed in NVRAM.
